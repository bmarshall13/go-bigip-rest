type MonitorRpc struct {

	// The application service to which the object belongs.
	AppService string `json:"appService,omitempty"`

	// Displays the administrative partition within which the monitor resides.
	Partition string `json:"partition,omitempty"`

	// User defined description.
	Description string `json:"description,omitempty"`

	// Specifies how often in seconds that the system issues the monitor check when the node is up. The default value is the same as the (down) interval.
	UpInterval int64 `json:"upInterval,omitempty"`

	// Specifies whether the system automatically changes the status of a resource to enabled at the next successful monitor check. If you set this option to yes, you must manually re-enable the resource before the system can use it for load balancing connections.
	ManualResume string `json:"manualResume,omitempty"`

	// Specifies the number of the program for which you want the monitor to verify availability.
	ProgramNumber string `json:"programNumber,omitempty"`

	// Specifies the existing monitor from which the system imports settings for the new monitor.
	DefaultsFrom string `json:"defaultsFrom,omitempty"`

	// Specifies the IP address and service port of the resource that is the destination of this monitor. Possible values are:  *:* (Specifies to perform a health check on the IP address and port supplied by a pool member), *:port (Specifies to perform a health check on the server with the IP address supplied by the pool member and the port you specify.), and  IP : port  (Specifies to mark a pool member up or down based on the response of the server at the IP address and port you specify.).
	Destination string `json:"destination,omitempty"`

	// Kind of entity
	Kind string `json:"kind,omitempty"`

	// Name of entity
	Name string `json:"name,omitempty"`

	// Specifies the frequency at which the system issues the monitor check. The default value is 10 seconds.
	Interval int64 `json:"interval,omitempty"`

	// Specifies the number of the version of the program for which you want the monitor to verify availability.
	VersionNumber string `json:"versionNumber,omitempty"`

	// Specifies the amount of time in seconds after the first successful response before a node will be marked up.  A value of 0 will cause a node to be marked up immediately after a valid  response is received from the node. The default setting is 0.
	TimeUntilUp int64 `json:"timeUntilUp,omitempty"`

	// Specifies the protocol that the monitor uses to communicate with the target. The default value is tcp. The options are tcp (Specifies that the monitor uses the TCP protocol to communicate with the target object.) and udp (Specifies that the monitor uses the UDP protocol to communicate with the target object.)
	Mode string `json:"mode,omitempty"`

	// Specifies the number of seconds the target has in which to respond to the monitor request. The default value is 31 seconds. If the target responds within the set time period, it is considered up. If the target does not respond within the set time period, it is considered down. Also, if the target responds with a RESET packet, the system immediately flags the target as down without waiting for the timeout interval to expire.
	Timeout int64 `json:"timeout,omitempty"`

	// Specifies whether the monitor sends error messages and additional information to a log file created and labeled specifically for this monitor. The default setting is no. You can use the log information to help diagnose and troubleshoot unsuccessful health checks. The options are 'no' (specifies that the system does not redirect error messages and additional information related to this monitor to the log file) and 'yes' (specifies that the system redirects error messages and additional information to the /var/log/monitors/ monitor_name - node_name - port .log file).
	Debug string `json:"debug,omitempty"`
