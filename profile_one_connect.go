type ProfileOneConnect struct {

	// The application service to which the object belongs.
	AppService string `json:"appService,omitempty"`

	LimitType string `json:"limitType,omitempty"`

	// Kind of entity
	Kind string `json:"kind,omitempty"`

	// User defined description.
	Description string `json:"description,omitempty"`

	// Specifies a source IP mask. The default value is 0.0.0.0. The system applies the value of this option to the source address to determine its eligibility for reuse. A mask of 0.0.0.0 causes the system to share reused connections across all clients. A host mask (all 1's in binary), causes the system to share only those reused connections originating from the same client IP address.
	SourceMask string `json:"sourceMask,omitempty"`

	// Displays the administrative partition within which this profile resides.
	Partition string `json:"partition,omitempty"`

	// Specifies the maximum age in number of seconds allowed for a connection in the connection reuse pool. For any connection with an age higher than this value, the system removes that connection from the reuse pool. The default value is 86400.
	MaxAge int64 `json:"maxAge,omitempty"`

	SharePools string `json:"sharePools,omitempty"`

	// Specifies the maximum number of connections that the system holds in the connection reuse pool. If the pool is already full, then the server-side connection closes after the response is completed. The default value is 10000.
	MaxSize int64 `json:"maxSize,omitempty"`

	// Specifies the profile that you want to use as the parent profile. Your new profile inherits all settings and values from the parent profile specified.
	DefaultsFrom string `json:"defaultsFrom,omitempty"`

	// Specifies the number of seconds that a connection is idle before the connection flow is eligible for deletion. Possible values are disabled, indefinite, or a numeric value that you specify. The default value is disabled.
	IdleTimeoutOverride string `json:"idleTimeoutOverride,omitempty"`

	// Specifies the maximum number of times that a server-side connection can be reused. The default value is 1000.
	MaxReuse int64 `json:"maxReuse,omitempty"`

	// Name of entity
	Name string `json:"name,omitempty"`
