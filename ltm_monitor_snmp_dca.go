// This describes a message sent to or received from some operations
type LtmMonitorSnmpDca struct {

	// The application service to which the object belongs.
	AppService string `json:"appService,omitempty"`

	// Displays the administrative partition within which the monitor resides.
	Partition string `json:"partition,omitempty"`

	// User defined description.
	Description string `json:"description,omitempty"`

	// Specifies the maximum acceptable CPU usage on the target server. The default value is 80 percent.
	CpuThreshold string `json:"cpuThreshold,omitempty"`

	// Specifies the community name that the BIG-IP system must use to authenticate with the host server through SNMP. The default value is public.
	Community string `json:"community,omitempty"`

	// Specifies the frequency at which the system issues the monitor check. The default value is 10 seconds.
	Interval int64 `json:"interval,omitempty"`

	// Specifies the maximum acceptable memory usage on the target server. The default value is 70 percent.
	MemoryThreshold string `json:"memoryThreshold,omitempty"`

	// Specifies the existing monitor from which the system imports settings for the new monitor.
	DefaultsFrom string `json:"defaultsFrom,omitempty"`

	// Specifies the maximum acceptable disk usage on the target server. The default value is 90 percent.
	DiskThreshold string `json:"diskThreshold,omitempty"`

	// Specifies the coefficient that the system uses to calculate the weight of the disk threshold in the dynamic ratio load balancing algorithm. The default value is 2.0.
	DiskCoefficient string `json:"diskCoefficient,omitempty"`

	// Kind of entity
	Kind string `json:"kind,omitempty"`

	// Name of entity
	Name string `json:"name,omitempty"`

	// Specifies user defined variables for the monitor. The name and value of the variable must be specified. If \"none\" is specified as the value then the variable is removed.
	UserDefined string `json:"userDefined,omitempty"`

	// Specifies the type of agent. The options are ucd, win2000, generic, and other.
	AgentType string `json:"agentType,omitempty"`

	// Specifies the IP address of the resource that is the destination of this monitor. The default value is *. Possible values are: * (Specifies to perform a health check on the IP address of the node.) or   IP  (Specifies to perform a health check on the IP address that you specify, route the check through the IP address of the associated node, and mark the IP address of the associated node up or down accordingly.).
	Destination string `json:"destination,omitempty"`

	// Specifies the coefficient that the system uses to calculate the weight of the CPU threshold in the dynamic ratio load balancing algorithm. The default value is 1.5.
	CpuCoefficient string `json:"cpuCoefficient,omitempty"`

	// Specifies the amount of time in seconds after the first successful response before a node will be marked up.  A value of 0 will cause a node to be marked up immediately after a valid  response is received from the node. The default setting is 0.
	TimeUntilUp int64 `json:"timeUntilUp,omitempty"`

	// Specifies the version of SNMP that the host server uses.
	Version string `json:"version,omitempty"`

	// Specifies the coefficient that the system uses to calculate the weight of the memory threshold in the dynamic ratio load balancing algorithm. The default value is 1.0.
	MemoryCoefficient string `json:"memoryCoefficient,omitempty"`

	// Specifies the number of seconds the target has in which to respond to the monitor request. The default value is 30 seconds. If the target responds within the set time period, it is considered up. If the target does not respond within the set time period, it is considered down. Also, if the target responds with a RESET packet, the system immediately flags the target as down without waiting for the timeout interval to expire.
	Timeout int64 `json:"timeout,omitempty"`
