# LtmVirtual

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**Destination** | **string** | Specifies the  virtual-address : port  on which the virtual server listens for connections.  virtual-address  can be an IP address or a previously created virtual-address. | [optional] [default to null]
**Mask** | **string** | Specifies the netmask for a network virtual server only. This setting is required for a network virtual server. The netmask clarifies whether the host bit is an actual zero or a wildcard representation. | [optional] [default to null]
**ServiceDownImmediateAction** | **string** | Specifies the immediate action to take upon the receipt of the initial client&#39;s SYN packet if the availability status of the virtual server is Offline or Unavailable. This is supported for the virtual server of Standard type and TCP protocol. The default value is none. | [optional] [default to null]
**Disabled** | **bool** | Note that when you disable a virtual server, the virtual server no longer accepts new connection requests. However, it allows current connections to finish processing before going to a down state. | [optional] [default to null]
**SourcePort** | **string** | Specifies whether the system preserves the source port of the connection. The default is preserve. Use of the preserve-strict setting should be restricted to UDP only under very special circumstances such as nPath or transparent (that is, no translation of any other L3/L4 field), where there is a 1:1 relationship between virtual IP addresses and node addresses, or when clustered multi-processing (CMP) is disabled. The change setting is useful for obfuscating internal network addresses. | [optional] [default to null]

**Description** | **string** | User defined description. | [optional] [default to null]
**RateLimitDstMask** | **int64** | Specifies a mask, in bits, to be applied to the destination address as part of the rate limiting.  The default value is &#39;0&#39;, which is equivalent to using the entire address - &#39;32&#39; in IPv4, or &#39;128&#39; in IPv6. | [optional] [default to 0]
**Nat64** | **string** | Specifies whether this virtual does NAT64 translation | [optional] [default to null]
**RateLimitMode** | **string** | Indicates whether the rate limit is applied per virtual object, per source address, per destination address, or some combination thereof.  The default value is &#39;object&#39;, which does not use the source or destination address as part of the key. | [optional] [default to null]
**ServicePolicy** | **string** | Name of the Service Policy. | [optional] [default to null]
**SynCookieStatus** | **string** | Displays the SYN Cookies status which controlled by The Traffic Management Microkernel (TMM). | [optional] [default to null]
**FallbackPersistence** | **string** | Specifies a fallback persistence profile for the virtual server to use when the default persistence profile is not available. | [optional] [default to null]
**DhcpRelay** | **bool** | Specifies a virtual server that relays all received DHCP requests to all pool members. If there is no pool, the received request get dropped. | [optional] [default to null]
**GtmScore** | **int64** | Specifies a score that is associated with the virtual server. Global Traffic Manager (GTM) can rely on this value to load balance traffic in a proportional manner. | [optional] [default to null]
**IpProtocol** | **string** | Specifies the IP protocol for which you want the virtual server to direct traffic. Sample protocol names are tcp and udp. | [optional] [default to null]

**IpForward** | **bool** | Specifies a virtual server like other virtual servers, except that the virtual server has no pool members to load balance. The virtual server simply forwards the packet directly to the destination IP address specified in the client request. Internal virtual servers do not receive external connections, instead they are specified by name by profiles in the parent virtual server (see ltm profile request-adapt and ltm profile response-adapt). Since internal virtual servers do not listen for external connections, not all attributes are used for internal virtual servers. The destination, mask, translate-address, translate-port, vlans, vlans-disabled and vlans-enabled attributes are set by the system, any attempt to change them will have no effect. | [optional] [default to null]
**MobileAppTunnel** | **string** |  | [optional] [default to null]
