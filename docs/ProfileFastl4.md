The default value is 0 (zero), which disables this option. You can specify an integer from 256 to 9162. | [optional] [default to 0]
**PvaFlowAging** | **string** | Specifies if enabling automatic epva flow aging when flow becomes idle or inactive for a period of time. use with care, | [optional] [default to null]
**PriorityToClient** | **string** | Specifies internal packet priority for the client side. This option specifies the internal packet priority that the system assigns to packets when sending them to clients.

**TimeoutRecovery** | **string** | Specifies late binding timeout recovery mode. This setting specifies the action to take when the client timeout expires. The default is to disconnect the connection. It can be configured to fallback to the normal FastL4 load-balancing for selecting the back-end servers. | [optional] [default to null]
