	UsernamePrompt string `json:"usernamePrompt,omitempty"`

	// User defined description.

	PasswordPrompt string `json:"passwordPrompt,omitempty"`

	// Specifies a list of folder prefixes that can be applied for file objects. This is a space separated list of folder prefixes, contained in curly braces. Example: \"{file:///shared/}\" or \"{file:///file/object/folder/} {/shared/}\". By default the folders are \"/shared/\" and \"/tmp/\", represented as \"{/shared/} {/tmp/}\".
	FileLocalPathPrefix string `json:"fileLocalPathPrefix,omitempty"`

	// Indicates a user-specified IP address for the system.  The default value is none. It is important to note that you must set the host-addr-mode option to custom, if you want to specify an IP address using custom addr. For more information, see the host-addr-mode option, below.
	CustomAddr string `json:"customAddr,omitempty"`

	// Warning: Do not use this parameter without assistance from the F5 Technical Support team. The system does not validate the commands issued using the include parameter. If you use this parameter incorrectly, you put the functionality of the system at risk.
	HostsAllowInclude string `json:"hostsAllowInclude,omitempty"`

	// Enables or disables the LCD display on the front of the system. The default is enabled.

If you enable this feature and then reboot the system, the system boots from an ISO image on the network, rather than from an internal media drive.

Note that this setting reverts to disabled after you reboot the system a second time.

	ConsoleInactivityTimeout int64 `json:"consoleInactivityTimeout,omitempty"`

	// Specifies the type of host address assigned to the system.  The default value is mgmt, which indicates that the host address is the management port of the system. If you use the state-mirror option, then the host address of the system is shared by the other system in a redundant pair. In case of system failure, the traffic to the other system is routed to this system. If you use the custom option, you must specify a custom IP address for the system using the custom addr option. For more information, see the custom addr option, above.
	HostAddrMode string `json:"hostAddrMode,omitempty"`

	// Specifies a local name for the system. The default value is bigip1.
	Hostname string `json:"hostname,omitempty"`

	GuiSecurityBannerText string `json:"guiSecurityBannerText,omitempty"`
